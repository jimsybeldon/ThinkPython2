That would make the function correct, but not very efficient. As an exercise, write a correct version of increment that doesn’t contain any loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions. In fact, some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs that use modifiers. But modifiers are convenient at times, and functional programs tend to be less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is reasonable and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a functional programming style.\n",

    "\n",
    "16.4  Prototyping versus planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The development plan I am demonstrating is called “prototype and patch”. For each function, I wrote a prototype that performed the basic calculation and then tested it, patching errors along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding of the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily complicated—since it deals with many special cases—and unreliable—since it is hard to know if you have found all the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is designed development, in which high-level insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a Time object is really a three-digit number in base 60 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal). The second attribute is the “ones column”, the minute attribute is the “sixties column”, and the hour attribute is the “thirty-six hundreds column”.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we wrote add_time and increment, we were effectively doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem—we can convert Time objects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a function that converts Times to integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "def time_to_int(time):\n",
    "    minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute\n",
    "    seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second\n",
    "    return seconds\n",
    "And here is a function that converts an integer to a Time (recall that divmod divides the first argument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).\n",
    "\n",
    "def int_to_time(seconds):\n",

    "    time.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)\n",
    "    return time\n",
    "You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions are correct. One way to test them is to check that time_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x for many values of x. This is an example of a consistency check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to rewrite add_time:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)\n",
    "    return int_to_time(seconds)\n",
    "This version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify. As an exercise, rewrite increment using time_to_int and int_to_time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with time values is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of writing the conversion functions (time_to_int and int_to_time), we get a program that is shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two Times to find the duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.\n",

    "A Time object is well-formed if the values of minute and second are between 0 and 60 (including 0 but not 60) and if hour is positive. hour and minute should be integer values, but we might allow second to have a fraction part.\n",

    "Requirements like these are called invariants because they should always be true. To put it a different way, if they are not true, something has gone wrong.\n",

    "Exercise 1  \n",
    "Write a function called mul_time that takes a Time object and a number and returns a new Time object that contains the product of the original Time and the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use mul_time to write a function that takes a Time object that represents the finishing time in a race, and a number that represents the distance, and returns a Time object that represents the average pace (time per mile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 2  \n",
    "The datetime module provides time objects that are similar to the Time objects in this chapter, but they provide a rich set of methods and operators. Read the documentation at http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the datetime module to write a program that gets the current date and prints the day of the week.\n",
    "Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user’s age and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.\n",
    "For two people born on different days, there is a day when one is twice as old as the other. That’s their Double Day. Write a program that takes two birth dates and computes their Double Day.\n",
