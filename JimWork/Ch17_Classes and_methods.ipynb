    "\n",
    "Although we are using some of Python’s object-oriented features, the programs from the last two chapters are not really object-oriented because they don’t represent the relationships between programmer-defined types and the functions that operate on them. The next step is to transform those functions into methods that make the relationships explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code examples from this chapter are available from http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2.py, and solutions to the exercises are in http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point2_soln.py.\n",

    "    17.1  Object-oriented features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it provides features that support object-oriented programming, which has these defining characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs include class and method definitions.\n",
    "Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.\n",
    "Objects often represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond to the ways things in the real world interact.\n",
    "For example, the Time class defined in Chapter 16 corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with times. Similarly, the Point and Rectangle classes in Chapter 15 correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-oriented programming. These features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide alternative syntax for things we have already done. But in many cases, the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the structure of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Time1.py there is no obvious connection between the class definition and the function definitions that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that every function takes at least one Time object as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation is the motivation for methods; a method is a function that is associated with a particular class. We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples. In this chapter, we will define methods for programmer-defined types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are semantically the same as functions, but there are two syntactic differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.\n",
    "The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.\n",
    "In the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous two chapters and transform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it by following a sequence of steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form to another, you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.\n",
    "\n",

    "And here is how you could use it:\n",

    ">>> duration = Time(1, 35)\n",
    ">>> print(start + duration)\n",
    "11:20:00\n",
    "When you apply the + operator to Time objects, Python invokes __add__. When you print the result, Python invokes __str__. So there is a lot happening behind the scenes!\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with programmer-defined types is called operator overloading. For every operator in Python there is a corresponding special method, like __add__. For more details, see http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames.\n",

    "As an exercise, write an add method for the Point class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    17.8  Type-based dispatch\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    def __add__(self, other):\n",

    "\n",
    "If other is a Time object, __add__ invokes add_time. Otherwise it assumes that the parameter is a number and invokes increment. This operation is called a type-based dispatch because it dispatches the computation to different methods based on the type of the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples that use the + operator with different types:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> start = Time(9, 45)\n",
    ">>> duration = Time(1, 35)\n",
    ">>> print(start + duration)\n",

    "    17.9  Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",

    "        else:\n",
    "            d[c] = d[c]+1\n",
    "    return d\n",
    "This function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries, as long as the elements of s are hashable, so they can be used as keys in d.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> t = ['spam', 'egg', 'spam', 'spam', 'bacon', 'spam']\n",
    ">>> histogram(t)\n",
    "{'bacon': 1, 'egg': 1, 'spam': 4}\n",
    "Functions that work with several types are called polymorphic. Polymorphism can facilitate code reuse. For example, the built-in function sum, which adds the elements of a sequence, works as long as the elements of the sequence support addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Time objects provide an add method, they work with sum:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> t1 = Time(7, 43)\n",
    ">>> t2 = Time(7, 41)\n",
    ">>> t3 = Time(7, 37)\n",
    ">>> total = sum([t1, t2, t3])\n",
    ">>> print(total)\n",
    "23:01:00\n",
    "In general, if all of the operations inside a function work with a given type, the function works with that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best kind of polymorphism is the unintentional kind, where you discover that a function you already wrote can be applied to a type you never planned for.\n",
    "\n",
    "    17.10  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "It is legal to add attributes to objects at any point in the execution of a program, but if you have objects with the same type that don’t have the same attributes, it is easy to make mistakes. It is considered a good idea to initialize all of an object’s attributes in the init method.\n",

    "If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in function hasattr (see Section 15.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to access attributes is the built-in function vars, which takes an object and returns a dictionary that maps from attribute names (as strings) to their values:\n",

    ">>> p = Point(3, 4)\n",

    "17.11  Interface and implementation\n",
    "One of the goals of object-oriented design is to make software more maintainable, which means that you can keep the program working when other parts of the system change, and modify the program to meet new requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A design principle that helps achieve that goal is to keep interfaces separate from implementations. For objects, that means that the methods a class provides should not depend on how the attributes are represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this chapter we developed a class that represents a time of day. Methods provided by this class include time_to_int, is_after, and add_time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could implement those methods in several ways. The details of the implementation depend on how we represent time. In this chapter, the attributes of a Time object are hour, minute, and second.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, we could replace these attributes with a single integer representing the number of seconds since midnight. This implementation would make some methods, like is_after, easier to write, but it makes other methods harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you deploy a new class, you might discover a better implementation. If other parts of the program are using your class, it might be time-consuming and error-prone to change the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you designed the interface carefully, you can change the implementation without changing the interface, which means that other parts of the program don’t have to change.\n",

Then modify the methods (and the function int_to_time) to work with the new implementation. You should not have to modify the test code in main. When you are done, the output should be the same as before. Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2_soln.py.\n",
