    "This system works fine if the keys are immutable. But if the keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key, or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The simplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next chapter.\n",

    "Since dictionaries are mutable, they can’t be used as keys, but they can be used as values.\n",

Variables in __main__ are sometimes called global because they can be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their function ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.\n",

    "11.8  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale down the input:\n",
    "If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first n lines.\n",
    "If there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check summaries and types:\n",
    "Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write self-checks:\n",
    "Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.\n",
    "Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format the output:\n",
    "Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We saw an example in Section 6.9. Another tool you might find useful is the pprint module, which provides a pprint function that displays built-in types in a more human-readable format (pprint stands for “pretty print”).\n",

    "Here’s another Puzzler from Car Talk (http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers):\n",
    "\n",
    "This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O’Leary. He came upon a common one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?\n",
    "Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. Let’s look at the five-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the dictionary from Exercise 1 to check whether a string is in the word list.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. You can download it from http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict or from http://thinkpython2.com/code/c06d and you can also download http://thinkpython2.com/code/pronounce.py, which provides a function named read_dictionary that reads the pronouncing dictionary and returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that describes its primary pronunciation.\n",
