    "\n",
    ">>> fin = open('/home')\n",
    "IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/home'\n",
    "To avoid these errors, you could use functions like os.path.exists and os.path.isfile, but it would take a lot of time and code to check all the possibilities (if “Errno 21” is any indication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is better to go ahead and try—and deal with problems if they happen—which is exactly what the try statement does. The syntax is similar to an if...else statement:\n",

    "\n",
    "Handling an exception with a try statement is called catching an exception. In this example, the except clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try again, or at least end the program gracefully.\n",

    "14.6  Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a file that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between a database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module dbm provides an interface for creating and updating database files. As an example, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image files.\n",

    "\n",
    ">>> import dbm\n",
    ">>> db = dbm.open('captions', 'c')\n",
    "The mode 'c' means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The result is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new item, dbm updates the database file.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese.'\n",
    "When you access one of the items, dbm reads the file:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png']\n",
    "b'Photo of John Cleese.'\n",
    "The result is a bytes object, which is why it begins with b. A bytes object is similar to a string in many ways. When you get farther into Python, the difference becomes important, but for now we can ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make another assignment to an existing key, dbm replaces the old value:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.'\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png']\n",
    "b'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.'\n",
    "Some dictionary methods, like keys and items, don’t work with database objects. But iteration with a for loop works:\n",
    "\n",
    "for key in db.keys():\n",
    "    print(key, db[key])\n",
    "As with other files, you should close the database when you are done:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> db.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "14.7  Pickling\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of dbm is that the keys and values have to be strings or bytes. If you try to use any other type, you get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pickle module can help. It translates almost any type of object into a string suitable for storage in a database, and then translates strings back into objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "pickle.dumps takes an object as a parameter and returns a string representation (dumps is short for “dump string”):\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import pickle\n",
    ">>> t = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> pickle.dumps(t)\n",

    "The format isn’t obvious to human readers; it is meant to be easy for pickle to interpret. pickle.loads (“load string”) reconstitutes the object:\n",

    ">>> t1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> s = pickle.dumps(t1)\n",
    ">>> t2 = pickle.loads(s)\n",
    ">>> t2\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "Although the new object has the same value as the old, it is not (in general) the same object:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> t1 == t2\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>> t1 is t2\n",
    "False\n",
    "In other words, pickling and then unpickling has the same effect as copying the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use pickle to store non-strings in a database. In fact, this combination is so common that it has been encapsulated in a module called shelve.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.8  Pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "Most operating systems provide a command-line interface, also known as a shell. Shells usually provide commands to navigate the file system and launch applications. For example, in Unix you can change directories with cd, display the contents of a directory with ls, and launch a web browser by typing (for example) firefox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Python using a pipe object, which represents a running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Unix command ls -l normally displays the contents of the current directory in long format. You can launch ls with os.popen1:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> cmd = 'ls -l'\n",
    ">>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\n",
    "The argument is a string that contains a shell command. The return value is an object that behaves like an open file. You can read the output from the ls process one line at a time with readline or get the whole thing at once with read:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> res = fp.read()\n",
    "When you are done, you close the pipe like a file:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> stat = fp.close()\n",
    ">>> print(stat)\n",
    "None\n",
    "The return value is the final status of the ls process; None means that it ended normally (with no errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, most Unix systems provide a command called md5sum that reads the contents of a file and computes a “checksum”. You can read about MD5 at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5. This command provides an efficient way to check whether two files have the same contents. The probability that different contents yield the same checksum is very small (that is, unlikely to happen before the universe collapses).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a pipe to run md5sum from Python and get the result:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> filename = 'book.tex'\n",
    ">>> cmd = 'md5sum ' + filename\n",
    ">>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\n",
    ">>> res = fp.read()\n",
    ">>> stat = fp.close()\n",
    ">>> print(res)\n",
    "1e0033f0ed0656636de0d75144ba32e0  book.tex\n",
    ">>> print(stat)\n",
    "None\n",
    "14.9  Writing modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module. For example, suppose you have a file named wc.py with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "def linecount(filename):\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    for line in open(filename):\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "    return count\n",
    "\n",
    "print(linecount('wc.py'))\n",
    "If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number of lines in the file, which is 7. You can also import it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import wc\n",
    "7\n",
    "Now you have a module object wc:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> wc\n",
    "<module 'wc' from 'wc.py'>\n",
    "The module object provides linecount:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> wc.linecount('wc.py')\n",
    "7\n",
    "So that’s how you write modules in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only problem with this example is that when you import the module it runs the test code at the bottom. Normally when you import a module, it defines new functions but it doesn’t run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs that will be imported as modules often use the following idiom:\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    print(linecount('wc.py'))\n",
    "__name__ is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is running as a script, __name__ has the value '__main__'; in that case, the test code runs. Otherwise, if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, type this example into a file named wc.py and run it as a script. Then run the Python interpreter and import wc. What is the value of __name__ when the module is being imported?\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does nothing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload, but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter and then import the module again.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.10  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs and newlines are normally invisible:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> s = '1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n",
    ">>> print(s)\n",
    "1 2  3\n",
    " 4\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function repr can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string representation of the object. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(repr(s))\n",
    "'1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n",
    "This can be helpful for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented \\n. Others use a return character, represented \\r. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies can cause problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most systems, there are applications to convert from one format to another. You can find them (and read more about this issue) at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline. Or, of course, you could write one yourself.\n",

    "If you download my solution to Exercise 2 from http://thinkpython2.com/code/anagram_sets.py, you’ll see that it creates a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the list of words that can be spelled with those letters. For example, 'opst' maps to the list ['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop', 'tops'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a module that imports anagram_sets and provides two new functions: store_anagrams should store the anagram dictionary in a “shelf”; read_anagrams should look up a word and return a list of its anagrams. Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/anagram_db.py.\n",

    "In a large collection of MP3 files, there may be more than one copy of the same song, stored in different directories or with different file names. The goal of this exercise is to search for duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that searches a directory and all of its subdirectories, recursively, and returns a list of complete paths for all files with a given suffix (like .mp3). Hint: os.path provides several useful functions for manipulating file and path names.\n",
    "To recognize duplicates, you can use md5sum to compute a “checksum” for each files. If two files have the same checksum, they probably have the same contents.\n",
    "To double-check, you can use the Unix command diff.\n",
    "Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/find_duplicates.py.\n",

    "popen is deprecated now, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using the subprocess module. But for simple cases, I find subprocess more complicated than necessary. So I am going to keep using popen until they take it away.\n",
